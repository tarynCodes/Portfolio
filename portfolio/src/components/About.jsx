        <p className='text-about'>Having spent the last eight years enjoying a fulfilling career as a
brewer,
 I am now seeking a fresh challenge in the tech industry as a
junior software developer. Throughout my time as a brewer, I found
enjoyment working on side projects, such as creating an educational
portal for customers and fellow staff members to enhance their
knowledge. This sparked my curiosity for coding, prompting me to delve
into self-study and then enroll in an intensive full-stack JavaScript
bootcamp with Northcoders.
The combination of hands-on projects and formal education has
provided me with a solid foundation in software development principles
and techniques. I am keen to channel my problem-solving skills and
creative outlook into the world of tech and to join a collaborative team
where I can contribute my diverse experiences and continue to grow
and learn.</p>
